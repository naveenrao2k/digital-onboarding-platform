# S3 Migration - Fresh Start Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This implementation replaces the legacy base64 encoding and file chunking approach with AWS S3 storage for a fresh database start.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Schema Updates:**
   - Removed `FileChunk` model completely
   - Removed legacy fields (`fileContent`, `isChunked`) from `KYCDocument` and `SelfieVerification`
   - Made S3 fields (`fileUrl`, `s3Key`) required

2. **Service Layer Updates:**
   - Updated `kyc-service.ts` to upload directly to S3
   - Updated `dojah-service.ts` to work with S3 URLs
   - Created comprehensive `s3-service.ts` for handling all S3 operations

3. **Migration Approach:**
   - Instead of migrating existing data, we've chosen a fresh start approach
   - Created a new migration script for a clean schema
   - Removed legacy migration scripts that handled file chunking

4. **Setup Script:**
   - Added `setup:fresh-db` script to initialize a fresh database with the S3 schema
   - This approach is cleaner than trying to migrate existing data

## How to Use

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure AWS credentials are set in your `.env` file
   - Create an S3 bucket for storing files

2. **Fresh Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run setup:fresh-db
   ```

3. **Upload Process:**
   - Files are now uploaded directly to S3 via the existing UI
   - No changes needed to the UI components

## Benefits

1. **Performance:** Faster file uploads and downloads
2. **Simplicity:** Cleaner code without legacy file handling
3. **Scalability:** Better handling of large files
4. **Maintenance:** Simpler database schema and fewer potential points of failure

## Next Steps

1. **Testing:** Verify all uploads, downloads, and integrations work with S3
2. **Monitoring:** Add CloudWatch metrics for S3 usage and performance
3. **Security:** Review S3 bucket policies and access controls

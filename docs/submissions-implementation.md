## Pagination Implementation

All three API endpoints implement pagination using:

1. **Query Parameters**
   - `page`: Current page number (default: 1)
   - `limit`: Results per page (default: 10)

2. **Response Format**
   - Returns data array with paginated results
   - Includes pagination metadata:
     - `total`: Total number of records
     - `page`: Current page number
     - `pageSize`: Results per page
     - `totalPages`: Total number of pages
     - `hasMore`: Boolean indicating if there are more pages

3. **Frontend Pagination Component**
   - Reusable component defined in `components/common/Pagination.tsx`
   - Shows page numbers and navigation controls
   - Allows configuring the number of items per page
   - Displays information about current range of items

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Add more advanced filtering options like date ranges
   - Implement multi-select filters

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching for frequent queries
   - Consider using optimistic updates for better UX

3. **Bulk Actions**
   - Add ability to approve or reject multiple documents at once

4. **Export Functionality**

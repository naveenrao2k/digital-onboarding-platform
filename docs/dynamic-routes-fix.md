# Fixing Next.js Static Generation Errors

## The Problem: Dynamic Server Usage Error

When building a Next.js application, you might encounter errors like:

```
Error: Dynamic server usage: Route /api/some/route couldn't be rendered statically because it used `cookies`.
```

This happens when a route uses server-side features like `cookies()` or other dynamic server components, but Next.js is trying to statically generate them during build time.

## The Solution: Force Dynamic Rendering

Add the following line at the top of any API route file that uses cookies or other server-side features:

```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

This explicitly tells Next.js that this route should be rendered dynamically at runtime, not during static generation.

## Where to Apply This

You should add this directive to any API route that:

1. Uses `cookies()` from next/headers
2. Uses `headers()` from next/headers
3. Uses dynamic data fetching that requires access to request-time information
4. Uses server-side session management

## Example Implementation

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers'; 

// Force dynamic rendering since this route uses cookies
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const sessionCookie = cookies().get('session');
  // Rest of your code...
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

- Clearer code intentions - explicitly states that the route is dynamic
- Prevents build-time errors related to static generation
- Properly handles routes that need access to request-time information
